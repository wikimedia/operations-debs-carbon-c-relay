Description: Carbon-compatible graphite line mode relay
 This project provides a multithreaded relay which can address multiple targets
 and clusters for each and every metric based on pattern matches.
 .
 Consistent-hash routing compatible with the original carbon's implementation
 is also provided. This relay also supports aggregation, failover of backend
 servers and more.
 .
 Carbon is graphite's default storage backend and supports different protocols
 for receiving metrics, this project aims to be a replacement of graphite's
 original carbon-relay component and supports "plaintext" protocol metrics.
